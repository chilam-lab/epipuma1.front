lb_msg_epsilon = Is the hypothesis test that determines if the conditional co-occurrence probability, P(C|X), is distinct from the null hypothesis, P(C), that the class and explanatory variable are independent. The formula is the following:
lb_msg_score = Is the \u201cscore\u201d contribution, s(X), for the variable X, that consists of the log of the risk ratio between the likelihoods P(X|C) and P(X|C\u2019), where C\u2019 is the set complement of C, i.e., those cells where there is \u201cno presence\u201d. If s(X) > 0, then X favours the presence of C and on the contrary if s(X) < 0. The formula is the following, where a Laplace correction of alpha = 0.01.):
